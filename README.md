# dbLearn* - Open-Source System for Conducting Iterative Exercises and Exams in a Databases Course

Features

- Library of tasks and tests for individual practice
  * Flexibility in defining as many task types as needed - each task type can be associated with a specific code editors in case such an editor is needed (there is support for SQL code to be used in coding and practical tasks, and there are text editors using specific symbol sets to be used in written and theory-based tasks)
  * Flexibility in defining as many collections as needed and their organization in a hierarchy if needed
- Test administration and management for organized group testing or individual testing
  * Test templates can be defined using a specific test structure
  * Test instances can be created based on test templates and conducted at a specific date
  * Test groups who are allowed to take each tests can be defined
  * Tests can be graded and reviewed
  * Support for transparency in grading - students can be allowed to view 
- Support for automatic and semi-automatic evaluation of SQL tasks based on correct solutions test samples implemented as database views

The system was presented at the ACM SIGITE 21:
- Vangel Ajanovski. 2021. DbLearn*: Open-Source System and a Set of Practices for Conducting Iterative Exercises and Exams in a Databases Course. In Proceedings of the 22st Annual Conference on Information Technology Education (SIGITE '21). Association for Computing Machinery, New York, NY, USA, 61â€“62. DOI:https://doi.org/10.1145/3450329.3478317

The system is used in production:
- Database courses taught by the main author since 2019 at the Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering, Ss. Cyril and Methodius University in Skopje.
