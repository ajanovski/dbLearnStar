# dbLearn* - Open-Source System for Conducting Iterative Exercises and Exams in a Databases Course

## Features

- Library of tasks and tests for individual practice
  * Flexibility in defining as many task types as needed - each task type can be associated with a specific code editors in case such an editor is needed (there is support for SQL code to be used in coding and practical tasks, and there are text editors using specific symbol sets to be used in written and theory-based tasks)
  * Flexibility in defining as many collections as needed and their organization in a hierarchy if needed
- Test administration and management for organized group testing or individual testing
  * Test templates can be defined using a specific test structure
  * Test instances can be created based on test templates and conducted at a specific date
  * Test groups who are allowed to take each tests can be defined
  * Tests can be graded and reviewed
  * Support for transparency in grading - students can be allowed to view 
- Support for automatic and semi-automatic evaluation of SQL tasks based on correct solutions test samples implemented as database views
- Support for rapid and semi-automated evaluation of database and schema design DDL tasks
